The OpenStack Foundation Transparency Policy
--------------------------------------------

This repository contains the OpenStack Foundation Transparency Policy.

See https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Governance/Foundation/TransparencyCommittee
for more details.

Approval Process
----------------

With proposed changes to the policy, the process would roughly be:

#. Someone proposes the changes by checking out the git repo, editing
   the document, and running the git-review command line too.
#. Discussion of the changes would happen through the gerrit web
   interface, with people able to propose changes in line.
#. The author would respond to that discussion, mostly likely making
   amendments, and uploading those new reviews to gerrit.
#. The proposal would be discussed in a committee meeting.
#. Eventually, the committee members would individually vote +1 on the
   proposal.
#. The proposal would be presented to the board, showing the diff, and
   the end result. Perhaps several changes would be proposed to the
   board at once.
#. Each change that is approved by the board is then merged into the
   repo using the gerrit web interface by either the foundation board
   chair or the committee chair.
